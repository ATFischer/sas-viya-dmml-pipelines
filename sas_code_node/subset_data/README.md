This example SAS code subsets your data based on values of a variable by writing out the score code to create a Filter variable (filter_flag) that is 0 for the observations that you want to keep, and 1 for those to be filtered out.  Then the metadata is modified to assign the role of Filter to this Filter variable.

Instructions: In Model Studio, add a SAS Code node to your pipeline, then open it and paste this code into the code editor, modify the code for subsetting for your needs (change the variable and values used), then save and close the node.  Nodes added to this SAS Code node will use this filter to subset your data for all subsequent nodes in the pipeline branch.
