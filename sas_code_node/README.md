## Summary

The **sas_code_node** folder contains example pipelines and materials for using Model Studio's SAS Code node.

In Model Studio, the SAS Code node is a Miscellaneous node that enables you to incorporate new or existing SAS code into Model Studio pipelines. This node can subsequently be moved to the Supervised Learning group if the model built in the node needs to be assessed and compared with other models in the pipeline using the Model Comparison node. When moving the node to Supervised Learning group, ensure that the required predicted variable or posterior probabilities necessary for model assessment are generated by the score code. For convenience, a large [list of macros and macro variables](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=vdmmlcdc&cdcVersion=8.3&docsetId=vdmmlref&docsetTarget=n1jewxtohvdh8vn15m6rzkndovvu.htm&locale=en) are made available to the user in the SAS Code node editor.

**IMPORTANT:** The exported data that is produced by a successful SAS Code node run can be used by subsequent nodes in a pipeline when the corresponding score code is written to a file referenced by **dm_file_scorecode** macro variable. See the subset_data folder for an example. 

Below are the list of examples; they are listed in the order of increasing complexity:
- **subset_data:** Subsetting or filtering data 
- **reverse_filter:** Reversing the outlier filter created by the Anomaly Detection node so that outliers are analyzed instead of being excluded
- **log_transform_for_skewed_inputs:** Setting the transformation for skewed variables to Log in the metadata, to be used by a subsequent Transformations node
- **cluster_profiling:** Profiling clusters or segments created in a predecessor Clustering node
- **class_level_indicators:** Creating class level indicators also called one-hot or dummy encoding for class/categorical inputs
